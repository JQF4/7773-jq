# 7773-FinalProject 
# Option Pricing Model

This project is a Python-based tool that utilizes several machine learning models to predict option prices. The core functionality includes fetching current stock prices, option chain data, and calculating option prices using the Black-Scholes model. The project aims to compare machine learning model predictions against traditional Black-Scholes pricing.

## Features

- Fetch current stock prices and options data using `yfinance`.
- Calculate Black-Scholes option prices.
- Feature engineering to prepare data for machine learning models.
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models including SVR, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM.
- Visualize feature importance and prediction results.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, SciPy installed
